                <p>Met with team on Tuesday and Friday (2hrs) <br>
                    Researched game sound design (1hr) <br>
                    Got readjusted with the LMMS DAW (software I'm using to make music/sounds) since I haven't used it in a while (1hr) <br>
                    Worked on making a sample chiptune song(3hrs) <br>
                    Worked on blog site (1hr)</p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Team was able to have two meetings which was a good introduction to meet everyone <br>
                    Everyone has their roles for the game <br>
                    Some good discussions in the discord server <br>
                    Personally, got more comfortable with making chiptune music in LMMS</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>Didn't have an assigned workshop period to work all together at once</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Research music instruments that fit the setting of the game (japan & western) <br>
                    Begin making start screen/main theme music (plays when you load up the game and at start screen) <br>
                    Meet with team to discuss long term amount of music, amount of sound effects, mood/atmosphere of the game at different points in the narrative <br>

                <h2>PPJ 02</h2>

                <img src="../images/wyatt/main_menu_lmms.png" alt="insert media content here">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I made my first song. The song relates to the setting/theme of the game and I was able to use a japanese taiko drum sound and shakuhachi flute to capture the setting <br>
                    Got blog functionality of website setup and working <br>
                    Good team discussions in the meetings</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>Still want to possible add in a melody in the middle of the main menu music to spice it up more. This will probably happen along the way as I get better with the music and go back and make small tweaks as needed.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Begin work on level 1 music</p>
