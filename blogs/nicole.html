                <h2>Nicole Harmon - PPJ #01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Writing Meeting - 1 hour <br>
                    Narrative and worldbuilding ideas brainstorming - 1 hour <br>
                    Full team meeting (responsible for meeting minutes) - 1 hour <br>
                    Total hours for the week: 3 hours
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Our team is headed in a good direction and we've got a good start. <br>
                    Everyone seems excited about the project and a lot of people keep contributing new ideas. <br>
                    The writers (which includes me) seem to be agreeing on ideas and I'm looking forward to getting to
                    flesh out the narrative and world a bit more in the coming weeks. <br>
                    People communicate well in our Discord.
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>It does seem that we're a little all over the place in terms of roles, as many want to do a bit of
                    everything. This isn't inherently bad by any means but could get messy if we don't keep organized.
                    <br>
                    I wasn't available for the Tuesday meeting and with a team this big, I'm worried this will keep
                    happening (for myself and others). However, as long as people stay involved with the Discord we'll
                    be fine!
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'm working on an overall game mechanics timeline with the developers this week. <br>
                    I'll also be working on some narrative stuff and looking at ways to implement narrative into a game
                    that doesn't inherently allow for a lot of it but definitely could if we want it to. <br>
                    I'll be helping with some design/art elements this week and next.</p>

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Narrative timeline setup - Â½ hour <br>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>The narrative team got a decent amount done towards the worldbuilding and general lore of the game,
                    including the narrative beatsheet. We should be able to move on to helping other teams with their
                    tasks full time soon. <br>
                    As a whole the team seems to be doing their tasks on time and we're moving along at a steady pace.
                    <br>
                    I'm personally happy with the work I did on the narrative side this week. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I realize that we don't really have a true art team and am worried about the more aesthetics based
                    tasks coming up. I don't have much experience with making and matching a consistent style across
                    multiple artists so I'm worried about how the art will look once we get more into working on it.
                    <br>
                    There is still some confusion about the role narrative will play in the game, so I'm not sure where
                    to go with things like dialogue writing just yet. <br>
                    We don't have answers for a few categories in the GDD just yet.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'll be working on a worldbuilding doc for the Bandit Leader (final boss) and his motivations this
                    week. <br>
                    I'll continue refining the GDD with Josh this week.
                </p>
