                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Writing Meeting - 1 hour <br>
                    Narrative and worldbuilding ideas brainstorming - 1 hour <br>
                    Full team meeting (responsible for meeting minutes) - 1 hour <br>
                    Total hours for the week: 3 hours
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Our team is headed in a good direction and we've got a good start. <br>
                    Everyone seems excited about the project and a lot of people keep contributing new ideas. <br>
                    The writers (which includes me) seem to be agreeing on ideas and I'm looking forward to getting to
                    flesh out the narrative and world a bit more in the coming weeks. <br>
                    People communicate well in our Discord.
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>It does seem that we're a little all over the place in terms of roles, as many want to do a bit of
                    everything. This isn't inherently bad by any means but could get messy if we don't keep organized.
                    <br>
                    I wasn't available for the Tuesday meeting and with a team this big, I'm worried this will keep
                    happening (for myself and others). However, as long as people stay involved with the Discord we'll
                    be fine!
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'm working on an overall game mechanics timeline with the developers this week. <br>
                    I'll also be working on some narrative stuff and looking at ways to implement narrative into a game
                    that doesn't inherently allow for a lot of it but definitely could if we want it to. <br>
                    I'll be helping with some design/art elements this week and next.</p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>The narrative team got a decent amount done towards the worldbuilding and general lore of the game,
                    including the narrative beatsheet. We should be able to move on to helping other teams with their
                    tasks full time soon. <br>
                    As a whole the team seems to be doing their tasks on time and we're moving along at a steady pace.
                    <br>
                    I'm personally happy with the work I did on the narrative side this week. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I realize that we don't really have a true art team and am worried about the more aesthetics based
                    tasks coming up. I don't have much experience with making and matching a consistent style across
                    multiple artists so I'm worried about how the art will look once we get more into working on it.
                    <br>
                    There is still some confusion about the role narrative will play in the game, so I'm not sure where
                    to go with things like dialogue writing just yet. <br>
                    We don't have answers for a few categories in the GDD just yet.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'll be working on a worldbuilding doc for the Bandit Leader (final boss) and his motivations this
                    week. <br>
                    I'll continue refining the GDD with Josh this week.

                    Clan Plans Snippet <br>
                    The Bandit Clan wasn't always as feared as it is today. They began like any other thieves, with
                    petty theft of general stores and stealing purses from old ladies. One day, however, one of the
                    founding members got their hands on an ancient weapon that elevated them just enough to gain some
                    notoriety. Rumors of who had stolen the ancient sword from one of the village elders circulated,
                    until the villagers had convinced themselves they were dealing with a clan much bigger than the
                    existing one. As such, their numbers swiftly grew as more and more approached the clan in hopes of
                    joining, whether for money or general intentions of cruelty.

                <img src="../images/nicole/palette_wk3.JPG" alt="">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Everyone is working together on ideas, even across teams, which is cool to see. <br>
                    Narrative stuff is likely closing out soon and we can start focusing on other areas, like design.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>GDD wasn't really worked on other than some format changes. <br>
                    Design team didn't have a meeting to discuss the future of the art direction, so I'm worried about
                    scope and what can be done before the next build.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'll be looking at the rest of the narrative stuff this week, like dialogue and cutscenes. <br>
                    We should be starting some more design heavy work this week, like environment assets.

                <p>
                    We have some more people working on art and design now. <br>
                    We have some concept art going for various things like bullets and environment art so we can
                    hopefully start implementing real assets soon. <br>
                    The main character sprite is coming along nicely. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There is a lot to be done for environment art and I'm worried I won't be able to get it all done, so
                    I'll have to delegate out tasks regardless of if people want to work on environment or not, which is
                    also worrying me. <br>
                    We've been having trouble finalizing the pixel density for art, but I think we might have finally
                    agreed on 16x16. <br>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>
                    We finally have art assets in the game, giving it a lot more personality. <br>
                    We were able to work together on fixes for the environment art, giving it more readability as a
                    background and ensuring it wouldn't be confusing for the player to distinguish between player
                    character and background. <br>
                    So far, the art style seems consistent across the game, my own stuff included, which was something
                    that worried me initially. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There was some miscommunication across the design team. <br>
                    Because I didn't understand how much the scope of the game had changed, I made concepts that are
                    less likely to get used. <br>
                    Because of the miscommunications, I didn't get to do the environment tiles for this week as I had
                    wanted to, but I did recolor them to make sure they'd fit better into the game. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll be continuing to work on the environment and creating some variations in environment tiles so
                    each floor doesn't look exactly the same. <br>
                    I'll keep working on decoration props and other assets. <br>
                    We'll hopefully be learning how to use tilemaps for environment art. <br>

                    We made a lot of progress in the art/design department this week. <br>
                    We onboarded some more people into level design, so levels should have more variety and get done
                    faster now. <br>
                    This is the first time I've made environment art (and pixel art) and I'm happy with how it all
                    turned out. <br>

                    Still unclear on tile maps and how we'll be using them, as well if I should be making them or just
                    making assets to give to the implementation team.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll probably be doing some different environments so we can have multiple themes.
                    I'll also be working on some more props to better flesh out the environment.

                <p>
                    Personally, I've gotten used to how to make pixel art environments and can more easily do so. <br>
                    I learned how to implement my own assets so that I can do it myself instead of delegating it to
                    someone else in the development team. <br>
                    Everyone seems to be moving along without much issue. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    I've had several issues with implementation as my computer is on the fritz and barely works anymore
                    which has slowed me down (consistent unity crashes, memory issues, etc.) <br>
                    We tend to find issues at the last minute, so it would be better if we could do some more
                    investigation early in the week rather than on Sundays. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll keep refining existing environment art. <br>
