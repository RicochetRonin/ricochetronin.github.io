                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Writing Meeting - 1 hour <br>
                    Narrative and worldbuilding ideas brainstorming - 1 hour <br>
                    Full team meeting (responsible for meeting minutes) - 1 hour <br>
                    Total hours for the week: 3 hours
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Our team is headed in a good direction and we've got a good start. <br>
                    Everyone seems excited about the project and a lot of people keep contributing new ideas. <br>
                    The writers (which includes me) seem to be agreeing on ideas and I'm looking forward to getting to
                    flesh out the narrative and world a bit more in the coming weeks. <br>
                    People communicate well in our Discord.
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>It does seem that we're a little all over the place in terms of roles, as many want to do a bit of
                    everything. This isn't inherently bad by any means but could get messy if we don't keep organized.
                    <br>
                    I wasn't available for the Tuesday meeting and with a team this big, I'm worried this will keep
                    happening (for myself and others). However, as long as people stay involved with the Discord we'll
                    be fine!
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'm working on an overall game mechanics timeline with the developers this week. <br>
                    I'll also be working on some narrative stuff and looking at ways to implement narrative into a game
                    that doesn't inherently allow for a lot of it but definitely could if we want it to. <br>
                    I'll be helping with some design/art elements this week and next.</p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>The narrative team got a decent amount done towards the worldbuilding and general lore of the game,
                    including the narrative beatsheet. We should be able to move on to helping other teams with their
                    tasks full time soon. <br>
                    As a whole the team seems to be doing their tasks on time and we're moving along at a steady pace.
                    <br>
                    I'm personally happy with the work I did on the narrative side this week. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I realize that we don't really have a true art team and am worried about the more aesthetics based
                    tasks coming up. I don't have much experience with making and matching a consistent style across
                    multiple artists so I'm worried about how the art will look once we get more into working on it.
                    <br>
                    There is still some confusion about the role narrative will play in the game, so I'm not sure where
                    to go with things like dialogue writing just yet. <br>
                    We don't have answers for a few categories in the GDD just yet.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'll be working on a worldbuilding doc for the Bandit Leader (final boss) and his motivations this
                    week. <br>
                    I'll continue refining the GDD with Josh this week.

                    Clan Plans Snippet <br>
                    The Bandit Clan wasn't always as feared as it is today. They began like any other thieves, with
                    petty theft of general stores and stealing purses from old ladies. One day, however, one of the
                    founding members got their hands on an ancient weapon that elevated them just enough to gain some
                    notoriety. Rumors of who had stolen the ancient sword from one of the village elders circulated,
                    until the villagers had convinced themselves they were dealing with a clan much bigger than the
                    existing one. As such, their numbers swiftly grew as more and more approached the clan in hopes of
                    joining, whether for money or general intentions of cruelty.

                <img src="../images/nicole/palette_wk3.JPG" alt="">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Everyone is working together on ideas, even across teams, which is cool to see. <br>
                    Narrative stuff is likely closing out soon and we can start focusing on other areas, like design.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>GDD wasn't really worked on other than some format changes. <br>
                    Design team didn't have a meeting to discuss the future of the art direction, so I'm worried about
                    scope and what can be done before the next build.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>I'll be looking at the rest of the narrative stuff this week, like dialogue and cutscenes. <br>
                    We should be starting some more design heavy work this week, like environment assets.

                <p>
                    We have some more people working on art and design now. <br>
                    We have some concept art going for various things like bullets and environment art so we can
                    hopefully start implementing real assets soon. <br>
                    The main character sprite is coming along nicely. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There is a lot to be done for environment art and I'm worried I won't be able to get it all done, so
                    I'll have to delegate out tasks regardless of if people want to work on environment or not, which is
                    also worrying me. <br>
                    We've been having trouble finalizing the pixel density for art, but I think we might have finally
                    agreed on 16x16. <br>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>
                    We finally have art assets in the game, giving it a lot more personality. <br>
                    We were able to work together on fixes for the environment art, giving it more readability as a
                    background and ensuring it wouldn't be confusing for the player to distinguish between player
                    character and background. <br>
                    So far, the art style seems consistent across the game, my own stuff included, which was something
                    that worried me initially. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There was some miscommunication across the design team. <br>
                    Because I didn't understand how much the scope of the game had changed, I made concepts that are
                    less likely to get used. <br>
                    Because of the miscommunications, I didn't get to do the environment tiles for this week as I had
                    wanted to, but I did recolor them to make sure they'd fit better into the game. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll be continuing to work on the environment and creating some variations in environment tiles so
                    each floor doesn't look exactly the same. <br>
                    I'll keep working on decoration props and other assets. <br>
                    We'll hopefully be learning how to use tilemaps for environment art. <br>

                    We made a lot of progress in the art/design department this week. <br>
                    We onboarded some more people into level design, so levels should have more variety and get done
                    faster now. <br>
                    This is the first time I've made environment art (and pixel art) and I'm happy with how it all
                    turned out. <br>

                    Still unclear on tile maps and how we'll be using them, as well if I should be making them or just
                    making assets to give to the implementation team.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll probably be doing some different environments so we can have multiple themes.
                    I'll also be working on some more props to better flesh out the environment.

                <p>
                    Personally, I've gotten used to how to make pixel art environments and can more easily do so. <br>
                    I learned how to implement my own assets so that I can do it myself instead of delegating it to
                    someone else in the development team. <br>
                    Everyone seems to be moving along without much issue. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    I've had several issues with implementation as my computer is on the fritz and barely works anymore
                    which has slowed me down (consistent unity crashes, memory issues, etc.) <br>
                    We tend to find issues at the last minute, so it would be better if we could do some more
                    investigation early in the week rather than on Sundays. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    I'll keep refining existing environment art. <br>
                    I'd like to make some more props to make environments look more interesting and feel more
                    believable. <br>

                    We seemed to have figured out the issues with the tilemap, so I was able to implement more stuff
                    this week.

                    Because of the break, everyone was traveling or unavailable so we had no meetings to check in on
                    work. <br>
                    I don't think the art I made for this week was quite what everyone was looking for, so I'll have to
                    continue refining this week. <br>

                <p>
                    As mentioned, I'll continue refining my work based on feedback for the final build. I don't think
                    anything brand new should be made as we approach the final week. <br>

                    Though I'm sure a lot of people will talk about this, I do feel that for the most part communication
                    was a net positive. There were a few times where tasks got confused or were entirely unclear to me
                    as the environment artist, but I was given opportunities to revise based off of feedback. In the
                    future I would do a better job of pursuing followup after meetings I couldn't attend (I wasn't able
                    to go to any Tuesday meetings because of class which is where some confusion came from) instead of
                    just reading the general notes in the Discord channels about the meetings. Asking for specifics
                    would hopefully prevent the confusion around tasks. When tasks in development needed to be done and
                    the devs were asked to pick up a task, usually someone would step up and this was good communication
                    and collaboration wise. <br> <br>
                    Everyone did a good job adapting to new roles and filling in where they needed to. I personally did
                    not want to do art coming into this and I was brand new to pixel art. However, it needed to be done,
                    and I'm happy with the work I was able to produce after stepping into the environment art role. I
                    wasn't the only one to do this, and I feel all of the level designers did well as they were brand
                    new to that. Everyone else did well with their roles though I was less involved with dev so I don't
                    know how new everyone was to Unity and games. <br> <br>
                    I think we kept the central vision of the game throughout development which was good. Though our
                    scope changed repeatedly and our idea for environment changed a lot, we stuck to the core mechanics
                    and base narrative which I'm happy with. The game is fun with the various enemy types and Ronin
                    abilities, if we had cut these I feel the game would be different than the core idea we started
                    with. I'm happy we were able to adapt to changes to still make something really fun and unique with
                    these mechanics. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Negative:</h4>
                <p>It was a common issue for people (myself included) to not get stuff in before implementation on
                    Sundays. Even though we ultimately learned to implement ourselves, it would have still been
                    beneficial for devs and level designers to have things earlier than Sunday nights. For my own part,
                    I think I'd benefit from a set time to work each week so that I have no choice but to work on game
                    stuff for that set amount of time. Often the hardest part for me is getting started on a task that
                    is daunting because I don't know what I'm doing, which was definitely the case with environment art.
                    Furthermore, I had a lot going on this term (20+ credits and extra curriculars got in the way a LOT
                    and derailed my work schedule for this class) so having that time built into my schedule as a
                    working meeting might be nice in the future. <br> <br>
                    Our environment assets changed a lot as I learned best practice and what looks best, as well as
                    while I revised based on feedback. Because of this, I think a lot of the level designers used the
                    wrong assets in their final levels, using earlier versions and incorrect tiles altogether as walls,
                    floors, and platforms. In the future, I'll make a point of making a reference sheet (including in
                    the GDD) for each asset piece, what they are, and what the most updated version is so there's no
                    more confusion. Even though I replaced things on the tilemap, it probably wasn't obvious to people
                    that they had to change what they had existing in their levels. This also makes my environment art
                    look inconsistent, but I updated everything as needed and I think there was just a disconnect
                    between design and level design. <br> <br>
                    Our level designers often used plain black bars as platform/wall assets. These don't blend well into
                    the environment and I think in the future it would be beneficial for me as the environment artist to
                    have some sort of weekly check-in with level design (outside of regular meetings) to really go over
                    the current state of levels and see what they need from me. I made horizontal platforms, but if they
                    needed others I didn't know about it in time. It would also help to have reference of what people
                    need in this case, which I was given in some cases so I would like it if I'm making a weirdly angled
                    platform that seems out of the norm. A more dedicated line of communication/weekly meeting between
                    level design and art design would be a net positive in the future (which isn't to say our
                    communication was bad! It just wouldn't hurt to have more, as always). <br>
