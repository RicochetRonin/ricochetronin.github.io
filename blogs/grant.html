                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I am really enjoying our team's dynamic, and even though we all need to get used to working together, it seems like it will be an enjoyable product. <br>
                    It seems like Douglas our effective team leader is really involved and interested in working on this project.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>

                <h4>Samples of Work: </h4>
                <p>Snippet from Artifacts’ Lore: <br>
                    “While he rested, their elements rose from the Omnijin and struck him down. Over the years, within the realm of men, the artifact saw many different owners. Powerful influential people tried to tap into its power, some successfully, others not. Over time, the stones that powered it (the ones containing the jins’ powers) got separated from the Omnijin, ending up in different hands at different times. If one were to reunite them, and wield the Omnijin proficiently, they may become near unstoppable.” <br>
                    Snippet from Mechanics Lore: <br>
                    “Using Yadomejustu, the ronin swings his broken sword in a flash. A silver arc can be seen following his arm, as he uses the remaining pieces of his blade to knock projectiles back from where they came. Over years of training in his ability to stop projectiles, by adding his own skill and knowledge of martial arts, he can turn simple projectile stopping into projectile redirecting. “</p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Narrative wise we were able to flesh a good amount about our world out this week, and came up with some very interesting ideas. <br>
                    Personally I am happy with some of the ideas I’ve been able to bring to the table Narratively and thematically, and would love to see them in the full game. <br>
                    In general, it seems like everyone is getting a good amount of work done personally, and is willing to contribute to the team.
                    </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>We still lack artists in general, and going forward we are gonna feel that more and more as we need more assets for the game. <br>
                    Dialogue is still kind of questionable, and we don’t know how narrative driven the game will actually end up being. <br>
                    Sometimes meetings can feel a little one sided, would like some more participation in general from people.
                    </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Design and more fleshing out of the artifact. Where it has been and how it got to where it is. <br>
                    Continue managing scrum and creating scrum presentations. <br>
                    Working on more worldbuilding for the enemy clan and enemy types that are within the game. <br>
                    Wherever else I can fill in as needed.
                    </p>
                <p>Total Hours Worked 10 ½ hours</p>
