                <h2>PPJ 01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Met with team, and established connections through discord. (20 min). <br>
                    Reviewed documents teammates had worked on, and got caught up from missing Monday's class and
                    Tuesday's meeting. ~ 1 hour <br>
                    Reviewed one page story board, and began brainstorming narrative ideas/designs. 30 minutes <br>
                    Met with team on Friday, got fully caught up and did final review of all our resources (1.5 hours)
                    <br>
                    Continued development of narrative pieces, and storylines for the game (40 min)
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I am really enjoying our team's dynamic, and even though we all need to get used to working together,
                    it seems like it will be an enjoyable product. <br>
                    It seems like Douglas our effective team leader is really involved and interested in working on this
                    project.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I personally don't have any negatives from this week of work. We are settling into our positions
                    still.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Concrete storyboarding/screenwriting for some of our narrative structure. Establish more concrete
                    pieces of our settings and characters.</p>
                <p>TOTAL : ~ 4 hours counting group wide meetings</p>

                <h4>Samples of Work: </h4>
                <p>Snippet from Artifacts’ Lore: <br>
                    “While he rested, their elements rose from the Omnijin and struck him down. Over the years, within
                    the realm of men, the artifact saw many different owners. Powerful influential people tried to tap
                    into its power, some successfully, others not. Over time, the stones that powered it (the ones
                    containing the jins’ powers) got separated from the Omnijin, ending up in different hands at
                    different times. If one were to reunite them, and wield the Omnijin proficiently, they may become
                    near unstoppable.” <br>
                    Snippet from Mechanics Lore: <br>
                    “Using Yadomejustu, the ronin swings his broken sword in a flash. A silver arc can be seen following
                    his arm, as he uses the remaining pieces of his blade to knock projectiles back from where they
                    came. Over years of training in his ability to stop projectiles, by adding his own skill and
                    knowledge of martial arts, he can turn simple projectile stopping into projectile redirecting. “</p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Narrative wise we were able to flesh a good amount about our world out this week, and came up with
                    some very interesting ideas. <br>
                    Personally I am happy with some of the ideas I’ve been able to bring to the table Narratively and
                    thematically, and would love to see them in the full game. <br>
                    In general, it seems like everyone is getting a good amount of work done personally, and is willing
                    to contribute to the team.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>We still lack artists in general, and going forward we are gonna feel that more and more as we need
                    more assets for the game. <br>
                    Dialogue is still kind of questionable, and we don’t know how narrative driven the game will
                    actually end up being. <br>
                    Sometimes meetings can feel a little one sided, would like some more participation in general from
                    people.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Design and more fleshing out of the artifact. Where it has been and how it got to where it is. <br>
                    Continue managing scrum and creating scrum presentations. <br>
                    Working on more worldbuilding for the enemy clan and enemy types that are within the game. <br>
                    Wherever else I can fill in as needed.

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Narrative explanation for enemy types - 1 ½ hour <br>
                    General Team Meetings - 1 ½ hours <br>

                <h4>Samples of Work: </h4>
                <p>Snippet from enemy type lore: <br>
                    Scorned by their leader, reflector type enemies stay on the front lines, the closest possible to
                    danger. Whether they disrespected the clan, their leader, or themselves, they now pay the price by
                    putting themselves on the line constantly to protect the rest of the clan. Most of them don't do it
                    willingly, but the looming threat of violence towards those they may care about most is enough to
                    make them hold their shields.
                </p>
                <h4>Basic Omnijin Design: </h4>
                <img src="../images/grant/omnijin.JPG" alt="">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>It seems like the development side of our team is working really well to implement parts of the game
                    where needed. <br>
                    I enjoy the direction our art is going, and think our narrative has a strong background <br>
                    We are falling more into the proper scrum motions

                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>We still lack artists in general, and going forward I am going to need to transition more into design
                    even though I lack a lot of the required skills <br>
                    With everything else going on this week at Drexel, I found it really hard to devote time to this
                    class and our project. <br>
                    Meetings still feel a little one sided, would like a little more interaction.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Transition into more of a design role, working on environments and more details for the artifact <br>
                    Continue managing scrum and creating scrum presentations <br>
                    Wherever else I can fill in as needed.

                <p>
                    Met with team twice for weekly scrum: 1 ½ hours <br>
                    Met with design team to figure out needed items: 1 hour <br>
                    Designed health bar for game usage: 1 hour <br>
                    Translated font into pixel art style, created basic menu buttons: 2 hours <br>
                    Spread survey for friends and related to take: 30 min <br>

                <p>
                    Our playtest build is in a much better place, with more interesting effects and better
                    implementation of abilities <br>
                    We will hopefully receive a good amount of responses from out surveying, and be able to implement
                    them. <br>
                    Our art design is finally getting started in larger portions, and we have more people working on it
                    each week. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There are some things about the game engine that feel like they need to be ironed out a bit. <br>
                    Personally I am not the best artist, so I am slightly worried about my ability going forward not
                    being good enough, but it is something I can practice on and hopefully improve <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    Polish out the menu items and UI items for the game, begin design on Artifact Sprite <br>

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>
                    Met with team on Tuesday/Friday for scrum activity: 2hrs <br>
                    Research tilesets and making pixel art tiles: 4 hours <br>
                    Created tiling for background, side walls, floor, platforms, ceilings, and window decorations : 4
                    hours <br>
                    Created Scrum presentation: 45 minutes <br>
                    Total Work 10:45 hours <br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We got started making concrete assets for our level design, I think they are coming together well,
                    and am proud of my work. <br>
                    While I was able to make the tiles, I needed some help actually getting the color right and Nicole
                    stepped up and helped a lot with recoloring things to make them less intrusive on gameplay. <br>
                    I think we have a better idea of what level design will need and what we'll need in terms of art.
                    It's difficult since no one has experience, but we are working through it well I think. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    This week was a little stressful, as it feels like we are rapidly approaching deadlines, but need to
                    finish a good amount of stuff.
                    It's been hard making some of the assets we need, as none of us really have good software and
                    hardware to make good art assets. It's a learning process for us all.
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    Next week I plan on polishing some of the visual assets we already have, as well as making new ones
                    to add more variety and fill some of our empty space. <br>
                    At this point, we need to look into polishing and finishing what we do have, instead of making new
                    stuff, so moving towards finishing and finalizing art assets. <br>

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>
                    Weekly group meetings: 2 hours <br>
                    Level Design onboarding: 2 hours <br>
                    Began mapping out level in terms of experiences wanted: 3 hours <br>
                    Got used to using tile maps in unity: 1 hour <br>

                <p>
                    We got a good amount of information from Professor Diefenbach, and are looking forward to trying to
                    implement a lot of his information in our level and game design. <br>
                    It seems like our project is reaching a closer to finished state, which makes me feel better overall
                    <br>
                    We are getting good information from our playtests on what to improve. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    There are definitely some glaring issues with our physics engine, and we likely still need art
                    assets. <br>
                    We won't be able to fully implement a lot of what we originally wanted to which is fine but always a
                    little sad <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    Next week I plan on fully implementing and testing my level designs into engine and putting it
                    together.
