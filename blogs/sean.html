                <h2>PPJ 01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Met with team on Tuesday for intro and start of one pager (1.5 hrs)<br>
                    Created team document for game mechanics. Brainstormed several ideas for bullet types, player abilities, and enemies. (1 hr)<br>
                    Met with team on Friday to determin upcoming tasks (1.5 hrs)<br>
                    Met with Doug on Saturday to get version control setup. Created a repository for the game in GitHub. Helped with pushing Doug's code to the repo, setting up a .gitignore file, creating several braches. (1 hr)
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I feel like the gameplay mechanics document has a lot of good ideas, plenty to work with. <br>
                    Despite the class having a lot of CS majors, it seems this team doesn't have a have a heavy programmer/developer "bias". Seems that tasks will split evenly. <br>
                    Had a head start on tech demo so was able to focus efforts on documentation for the week.</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>A lot of gameplay mechanic ideas were written down, however, I never reviewed them with other members of the team to determine which ones will actually be implemented. <br>
                    As a result of not reviewing gamplay mechanics, we were not able to submit a deliverables timeline for the mechanics.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Setting up Unity Project on my personal machine. <br>
                    Meet with Ryan and Nicole to create deliverables timeline for gameplay mechanics <br>
                    Begin implementing mechanics</p>
                <p>Total Hours for the week: ~5hrs <br>

                <h2>PPJ 02</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>General Team Meeting/Scrum Updates (3.5 hrs) <br>
                    Met with Dev team to determine game mechanics to be implemented and their deadline (1.5 hrs) <br>
                    Implemented Sniper Enemy Prefab (3.5 hrs) <br>
                    Implemented Dash Ability (3 hrs) <br>
                    Met with Design and Dev team to review Github merging. Merged all completed tasks (1 hrs)
                </p>

                <img src="../images/sean/dash_demo.gif" alt="insert media content here">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>While creating the Sniper Enemy, I was also able to implement a “Charge” method that is tied to the enemy's fire rate. Currently it changes the color of the enemy, but it could be refactored and prove to be helpful later on. <br>
                    The Dash ability works very well. I think it’ll prove to be a highly used and helpful ability. <br>
                    There have been minimal issues while merging all of the new development.</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>There was some difficulty while setting up the Dash ability. I haven’t used Unity’s new input system before, so I had to take some time to learn that. Because of this, there were some issues getting it to work correctly.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Create Bullet Helly enemies. <br>
                    Create the Omni-Reflect Ability</p>

                <p>General Team Meeting/Scrum Updates (2 hrs) <br>
                    Implemented Pulse Enemy Prefab (4 hrs)

                <p>Sample of Enemy Pulse</p>
                <img src="../images/sean/enemy_pulse.gif" alt="">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Pulse enemy has been implemented. I’m happy that I was able to create it so that it can either aim at the player and shoot, or stay still and shoot.</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I did not get to implement the Omni-Reflect Ability like I planned to. <br>
                    I spent a lot of time trying to make the Pulse enemy highly customizable with its fire pattern, however, I ran into difficulties while implementing. As a result, it is more barebanes than I’d like it to be. <br>
                    I wasn’t as active on Discord as I’d like to be this week.

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Fix Dash mechanic on Level 1 (.5 hrs) <br>
                    Implementing Omni-Reflect mechanic (8 hrs) <br>
                    Adding particle system to Omni-Reflect and Reflect (2 hrs) <br>

                <img src="../images/sean/muzzleflash.gif" alt="insert media content here">
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Omni-Reflect works just as intended. While it’s not possible to aim where the bullets are redirected with aim controls, I think players should be able to figure out where bullets will go based on where it hits on the Omni-Reflect collider. <br>
                    I was able to implement the Omni-Reflect early in the week, so I had some extra time to work with Unity’s particle system for the basic reflect and Omni-Reflect. I’m happy with how they came out.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>Omni-Reflect took longer than expected to implement due to the bullets not using Unity’s physics system. Had to do a bit more math to figure out the direction bullets should reflect. <br>
                    I did make some progress refactoring the Pulse enemy, bullets will now spawn in a radius around the enemy rather than the complete center of the enemy. However, each bullet now spawns at an incorrect rotation which needs to be fixed.

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I was able to implement a lot of the design team’s sprite animations. It’s cool to see the work of design and dev come together now. <br>
                    I didn’t work with Animations or the Animator in Unity before, so this week provided a good learning experience for them.

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I’m happy I was able to figure out the issues relating to mouse and gamepad aiming. They’ve been in our game for awhile and I was skeptical I’d be able to figure them out. I do think it is a very noticeable fix and improves the feel of the game. <br>
                    I got to work on a variety of tasks this week and was able to complete more than I was issued. Overall, this was a pretty productive week for me.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>For a few weeks, I’ve had to leave our Sunday implementation meetings early and I had to again this week. It’s a good opportunity to make sure everything is ready before our build of the week and I don’t like that I haven’t been there for the entire meeting.</p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I feel like I’ve been pretty consistent at completing my tasks for the past few weeks. <br>
                    With all the bug fixes and design assets being added, our game is getting some real polish and is looking like a good vertical slice for our game. 
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>For the trailer, I waited until I implemented my tasks so my clips would look better. My tasks ended up taking longer to implement then I originally thought, pushing back my submission for game clips and blocking the trailer. <br>
                    While the bullet Muzzle Flash and Impact animations are in, they are not implemented efficiently. I tried object pooling at first but ran into issues. Currently, game objects are spawned and then destroyed.

                <h2>PPJ 09</h2>
                <h4>What went right: </h4>
                <p>Our team was initially uneven in terms of skill sets, we had a lot of members with development experience and not a lot with design experience. Despite this bias, however, I think that the members who tried design work really stepped up to the plate and put out some solid work. <br>
                    I think the development team was generally in sync with each other. We had minimal issues and conflicts whenever we merged our work for the week. <br>
                    Despite not completing all the goals we had initially set out to complete, we were able to effectively scope down and still have a solid vertical slice to showcase.
                    
                </p>
            
                <h4> What went wrong: </h4>
                <p>At one point, we had more design team members start implementing their own work on our development branch. There were some issues merging branches, as some of my implementations were overwritten by another. This took a few hours to fix which could’ve been better spent elsewhere. <br>
                    I’d say our team generally did things later than we should have. This applies to creating PPJ entries, creating new builds, and collecting playtest data. While we were able to submit most of our deliverables on time, I feel that some haven’t had the best quality. <br>
                    We were able to implement a lot of enemies, abilities, and VFX into our game, however, everything may not have been implemented in the best way. For example, the impact animations that play whenever a bullet hits a wall are game objects that are instantiated and destroyed. This isn’t optimized, as they should use object pooling. There’s a few things like this that could be better optimized but weren’t due to lack of time.
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Lessons Learned Going Forward: </h4>
                <p>Professor Diefenbach mentioned that dev and design should work together closely. Each 
                    team shouldn’t just work on their own work and combine it in the end. They should work 
                    together from the start so they know what to expect from the other in the end. Looking 
                    back on some of the assets we created, I think they would’ve been easier to create had 
                    I known what to expect from the design team. Going forward, I plan to better follow 
                    Professor Diefenbach’s method of asset creating, reaching out to the design team early 
                    on.
