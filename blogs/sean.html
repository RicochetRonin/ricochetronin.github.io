                <h2>PPJ 01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Met with team on Tuesday for intro and start of one pager (1.5 hrs)<br>
                    Created team document for game mechanics. Brainstormed several ideas for bullet types, player abilities, and enemies. (1 hr)<br>
                    Met with team on Friday to determin upcoming tasks (1.5 hrs)<br>
                    Met with Doug on Saturday to get version control setup. Created a repository for the game in GitHub. Helped with pushing Doug's code to the repo, setting up a .gitignore file, creating several braches. (1 hr)
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>I feel like the gameplay mechanics document has a lot of good ideas, plenty to work with. <br>
                    Despite the class having a lot of CS majors, it seems this team doesn't have a have a heavy programmer/developer "bias". Seems that tasks will split evenly. <br>
                    Had a head start on tech demo so was able to focus efforts on documentation for the week.</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>A lot of gameplay mechanic ideas were written down, however, I never reviewed them with other members of the team to determine which ones will actually be implemented. <br>
                    As a result of not reviewing gamplay mechanics, we were not able to submit a deliverables timeline for the mechanics.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Setting up Unity Project on my personal machine. <br>
                    Meet with Ryan and Nicole to create deliverables timeline for gameplay mechanics <br>
                    Begin implementing mechanics</p>
                <p>Total Hours for the week: ~5hrs <br>
                    Dev, Week 3, Sean Dembeck</p>

                <h2>PPJ 02</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>General Team Meeting/Scrum Updates (3.5 hrs) <br>
                    Met with Dev team to determine game mechanics to be implemented and their deadline (1.5 hrs) <br>
                    Implemented Sniper Enemy Prefab (3.5 hrs) <br>
                    Implemented Dash Ability (3 hrs) <br>
                    Met with Design and Dev team to review Github merging. Merged all completed tasks (1 hrs)
                </p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>While creating the Sniper Enemy, I was also able to implement a “Charge” method that is tied to the enemy's fire rate. Currently it changes the color of the enemy, but it could be refactored and prove to be helpful later on. <br>
                    The Dash ability works very well. I think it’ll prove to be a highly used and helpful ability. <br>
                    There have been minimal issues while merging all of the new development.</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>There was some difficulty while setting up the Dash ability. I haven’t used Unity’s new input system before, so I had to take some time to learn that. Because of this, there were some issues getting it to work correctly.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Create Bullet Helly enemies. <br>
                    Create the Omni-Reflect Ability</p>
                <p>Total Hours for the week: ~12.5hrs <br>
                    Dev, Weeks 4 and 5, Sean Dembeck</p>
