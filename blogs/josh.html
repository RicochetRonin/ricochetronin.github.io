                <p>
                    We are finding a consistent identity with our game now! <br>
                    There is alot of progress being made with the games development, so more people will be able to
                    transition to design and make cool art for the game!

                <h4> Negative: </h4>

                    Design is going well, we are getting stuff established and ready to be made! <br>
                    I have been able to get back into pixel art and im remembering how much fun it is to make! <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    The game is getting done but hard to know if we are on track to finish major deadlines. <br>
                    Lots of art needs to be made, and some of it is made already but with inconsistent pixel density.
