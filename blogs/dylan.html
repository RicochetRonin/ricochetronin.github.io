                <h2>PPJ #9</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>meeting (4.5 hours) <br>

                    new art, level geometry (1 hour)
                    
                </p>
                <h4>What went right: </h4>
                <p>The people developing the art, mechanics, and levels worked well together to arrive at a complete final product. <br>
                    Learning version control to a point where I pretty much understand it. <br>
                    The team showed up to the meetings and were vocal about things.
                    
                </p>
            
                <h4> What went wrong: </h4>
                <p>There were many instances I felt blocked by needing help from a member of the dev team. <br>
                    Doing level design without the final product clearly in mind meant needing to change many things. <br>
                    The narrative elements were severely limited or cut from the game.
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Lessons Learned Going Forward: </h4>
                <p>It’s important to scope back early on and to voice concerns about mechanics changes and 
                    whatnot. Also, reaching out through the team’s messaging channels is important so they 
                    can know what’s going on. Overall, I think the team worked well together and I wish we 
                    could’ve kept going a little while longer.
