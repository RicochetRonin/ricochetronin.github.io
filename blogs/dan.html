                <h2>PPJ 09</h2>
                <h4>What went right: </h4>
                <p>Team had great leadership and communication/organization during meetings. <br>
                    Everyone was able to contribute greatly to the project each week. <br>
                    Everyone on the team was very helpful and willing to give assistance with anything I was having issues with.
                    
                    
                </p>
            
                <h4> What went wrong: </h4>
                <p>Organization started to slowly deteriorate towards the end of the project. <br>
                    As a group we lacked artists and had an overabundance of developers which led to some deficiency on the art side of the project. <br>
                    A lot of time was spent learning some of the tools that we were using, such as CineMachine.
                    
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Lessons Learned Going Forward: </h4>
                <p>Communication is essential to be successful for a project such as this. <br>
                    Diversify my skill set so I can work more tasks other than just development.
                    
                </p>
                <h4>Changes for next project</h4>
                <p>If I were to work on another game dev project, I would make sure I spend more time 
                    learning the tools that we’re going to use in the beginning before production ramps up. 
                    I would also make sure I’m better with communication and updating the status of my tasks.
