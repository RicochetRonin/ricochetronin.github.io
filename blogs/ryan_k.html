                <h2>Ryan Kalbach PPJ 01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Met team members and set up weekly meeting times <br>
                    Brainstormed game mechanics and added ideas to master document <br>
                    Brainstormed possible enemy/boss designs and mechanics <br>
                    Did research for concept art <br>
                    Total hours worked: 10hrs
                </p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>We divided up work effectively <br>
                    Our leader was pretty lenient as to who can work on what parts of the project, good for
                    communication and helps everyone be more involved <br>
                    Excited about the idea gameplay-wise and aesthetics-wise <br>
                    Everyone contributes, and has really good ideas about the gameplay
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>A little behind on the concepts and mood board <br>
                    Lack of art people is hurting us <br>
                    Although I want to do mechanics design as well as visual design, I may end up having to focus on
                    just art due to the above <br>
                    Team generally seems a bit disorganized, probably just a slow start though <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Finish moodboard, concept art for week 3
                </p>

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>
                    Developed moodboard with design team <br>
                    Fleshed out concepts for main character and environment <br>
                    Produced character concept art <br>
                    Discussed color scheme <br>
                </p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>
                    Made a lot of good progress design side <br>
                    We have more manpower on the design team now, reducing stress <br>
                    We're all on the same page now in terms of aesthetics and our overall goal for the game's feel <br>
                    Char art looking nice :) <br>
                    Total hours worked: 12hrs
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>Although this phase went smoothly, I'm worried about the work it will take to create sprites and
                    animations for the character. I (and everyone else afaik) don't have much experience in animation,
                    so this could be tough.</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    Main character sprites and basic animations, enemy design concepts if time permits
                </p>

                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>
                    Player character sprite/animations <br>
                    Set up/figure out pixel art+animation workflow <br>
                    Get idle animation working and presentable <br>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>
                    I was worried about learning pixel art but it's not that bad <br>
                    I like how my work is turning out so far <br>
                    Pretty fun <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    A lot of animations left to do, and I want to make some improvements to the existing idle anim if I
                    have time <br>
                    I have explicitly asked for feedback on my work and have gotten almost nothing <br>
                    Despite planning to reallocate some developers to design work eventually, I'm still pretty much on
                    my own here
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    More animations, talk with other people if anyone wants to help me
                </p>

                <p>
                    Meet with design team and discuss plan of action moving forward
                    Continued work on ronin animations
                    Total hours worked: 18hrs
                </p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>
                    Other people are working on design now, takes some of the load off of me and I can focus on just
                    characters <br>
                    Animations are looking nice <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    We have 8 different enemy types that all need designs, sprites and animations, and it looks like I'm
                    doing all of those. I'll either have to put in a ton of work, or skimp on the designs and reuse
                    pieces wherever I can. Either way, that comes after I finish the player character so maybe it'll
                    work itself out by then. <br>
                    None of the art team's work has been implemented in the game yet and I'm concerned we're
                    underestimating the amount of work that will take. <br>
                    After playtesting our current build myself, I'm worried that our scope is too wide. We have 8
                    different enemy types almost completely implemented, and meanwhile our jump barely works. I think we
                    need to reallocate our development resources to focus on the core gameplay, instead of just tacking
                    extra things on arbitrarily. <br>
                </p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>
                    Finish player char. animations by alpha build due date next week <br>
                </p>
