                <h2>PPJ 01</h2>
                <h4>Tasks: </h4>
                <p>Set Up Times for Sprint Planning Meetings throughout the week (Took a day for everyone to get their
                    times in) <br>

                    Set Up Discord (took me about an hour to set up all the channels, invite everyone, and post initial
                    messages) (1 hr) <br>

                    Introductions about experience and role on the team (2 hours for the entire team is introduce
                    themselves through messages in the discord, ) <br>

                    Met Tuesday - introductions, onboarding, One pager (1 1/2 hrs) <br>

                    Started documentation for narrative aspects and one for mechanics and our timeline <br>

                    Josh set up the website and got everyone on it (2hrs? Not too sure, he did it after our Tuesday
                    meeting) <br>

                    Met Friday - finalized roles, setup the HacknPlan and got everyone on it, set up Tasks to be done by
                    next meeting (1 ½ hrs) <br>

                    I met with Sean Saturday and we set up the Github Repo (1 hr) <br>

                    Sunday - posted tech demo, finalized elevator pitch (2 hrs)</p>
                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>A lot of people took initiative and it was easy to hash out task and expectations <br>

                    Good communication, it's easy to get hold of one another and discuss/make decisions even with little
                    notice <br>

                    Good ideas all round from the design side, development side, and writers <br>

                    I was able to set up a lot of our organization quickly, what software we are going to be using,
                    everyone's roles</p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>We are still warming up to one another and we don't have a dedicated time reserved for working all
                    together <br>

                    I was a little slow at commencing meetings at the Sprint Planning</p>
                <h4>Upcoming: </h4>
                <p>Writers have begun creating narrative reasonings for the mechanics as well as the setting and
                    characters <br>

                    Designers have begun making concept art and ideas for character design and pixel art <br>

                    Timeline is being created on development side <br>

                    Onboarding everyone into github <br>

                    Grayboxing level one <br>

                    Combining the tech demo versions</p>
                <p>Total Hours for the week: ~10 hrs <br>

                    Dev, Production, Week 3, Douglas</p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>The team got the scrum pipeline down for quicker meetings, allowing us to transition into focusing on
                    important tasks. <br>
                    Delegation went swimmingly, most people were able to finish their tasks independently and
                    communicate with the group about any road bumps. <br>
                    I was able to hash out many of my development and production tasks quickly as well as make up for
                    absences on the team during the team meetings.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>I promised I would help fill a void in design but I have not been motivated to do any design tasks
                    yet. <br>
                    I am feeling the lack of design and assets and am afraid it will be hard to achieve our unique
                    aesthetic without having a lot of the team transition towards design. <br>
                    As narrative wraps up a lot of the writing and documentation is smoothed out, we will have people
                    transition towards completing design work.</p>

                <h4>Positive: </h4>
                <p>Sprite art is looking quite good. While everyone was quite busy, we were still able to coordinate our
                    meetings and make progress on our task even without much completion or communication.
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>Very busy week, I was not able to work a lot on my tasks nor does it seem like many others were. I
                    failed to follow up with all of those who missed Tuesday's meeting and communicate about their
                    updated tasks.

                <p>
                    We caught up on a lot of tasks. I had more time this week to delegate towards working on the game so
                    I was able to iron out a lot of bugs from the playable build. We had an implementation meeting which
                    went well and was relatively quick, granted I did do an implementation of the dev branch beforehand
                    so that most likely helped. <br>
                    I successfully rebalanced some of the task delegation so that team members were able to complete
                    tasks with higher priority. <br>
                    The design team made a lot of strides this week and we are well on our way progressing there. <br>
                </p>
                <h4> Negative: </h4>
                <p>
                    I feel like the deliverables always seek up on me, as in I never realize we have more team wide
                    submissions that are due such as playtests being required from every team member. I am going to
                    start going over the weekly deliverables during class on Monday or our Tuesday meetings rather than
                    viewing them Friday and only giving our team the weekend to finish their deliverables. <br>
